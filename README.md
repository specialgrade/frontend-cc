# Frontend Playground  

This repository is my **frontend development playground**, where I explore, practice, and build projects to sharpen my skills in web development. It includes small experiments, personal projects, responsive layouts, and interactive components that reflect my growth as a frontend developer.

## Structure  
- Inside are subfolders or files for experiments, components, and projects.  
- Some entries include notes or explanations for concepts I explored.

- Explore modern frameworks, tools, and responsive design techniques.  
- Document my progress and growth as a frontend developer in IT.  

## Tech Stack Practiced  
- **HTML5** – Structuring web pages.  
- **CSS3 (SCSS, Tailwind CSS)** – Styling, responsive design, and layouts.
